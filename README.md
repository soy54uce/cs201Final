CPU Simluation of Process Scheduling

"Create a simulation engine in the C language to model the behavior of a process dispatcher in an operating system, moving processes from the ready state to the running state."

Use three different dispatching algorithms
	first come first served (FCFS)
	shortest-job-first (SJF)
	round-robin (RR)
